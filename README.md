## ArtCorner – AI & Data-Driven ERP System

## 1. Overview
ArtCorner is a full-stack ERP system built for small to medium retail businesses.
It manages inventory, sales, purchases, customers, and financial transactions, with a strong emphasis on data integrity, clean architecture, and scalability.

The project was initially implemented using Firebase (direct client access) and is currently being migrated to a Spring Boot backend to centralize business logic and improve maintainability.

**Current focus:** building a data-driven backend with analytical pipelines and AI-ready reporting capabilities.

## 2. Architecture
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (RESTful API)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Desktop & Mobile)

---

## 3. Key Features
- Inventory and stock management
- Sales and purchase processing
- Customer debt tracking and payments
- Transaction-safe operations using `@Transactional`
- Sale item status tracking
- Data-driven analytics and AI-assisted reporting (in progress)

---

## 4. Technical Highlights
- Multi-tier architecture (Controller, Service, Repository, DTO layers)
- SOLID principles and clean code practices
- DTO pattern to decouple persistence and API layers
- Relational database design optimized for transactional and analytical queries
- SQL-based analytical views for business reporting
- Python-based ETL pipelines using Pandas for data aggregation and transformation
- AI & Prompt Engineering foundations for generating structured insights from historical sales data

---

## AI-Assisted Reporting (In Progress)

ArtCorner includes an AI-assisted analytics layer designed to translate 
business questions into structured analytics requests.

A Large Language Model (LLM) is used strictly as a deterministic interpreter that converts
natural language questions into predefined JSON analytics formats.

Key characteristics:
- No SQL is generated by the AI
- Analytics are executed only on pre-aggregated tables
- Strict validation between AI output and backend execution
- Safe, predictable, and auditable design

This approach allows business users to query analytical insights using natural language
while maintaining full control over data access and execution logic.

## 5. Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Analytics:** SQL Views, Python, Pandas
- **Cloud & Tools:** Firebase Firestore (legacy), Git/GitHub, Postman, Docker
  *(AWS deployment planned)*

## 6. Migration Note
This repository includes:
- A legacy Firebase-based implementation (direct client access)
- A new Spring Boot backend that centralizes business logic and supports future analytics and AI integration
